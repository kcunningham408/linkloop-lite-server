  <h2>Personal Wellness Journal</h2>
  <p>LinkLoop is a personal wellness journal app for logging and organizing your Type 1 Diabetes information. It is NOT a medical device. It does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or condition. It does not connect to medical devices or provide clinical monitoring.</p>
  <h2>What LinkLoop Does</h2>
  <p>LinkLoop lets you manually log glucose readings, track supplies, share updates with a personal Care Circle, and view pattern observations based on data you enter. All features are informational and for personal use only.</p>
  <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of data you enter. Insights and observations are based on your self-entered data and are for personal reference only — not for making health decisions.</p>
