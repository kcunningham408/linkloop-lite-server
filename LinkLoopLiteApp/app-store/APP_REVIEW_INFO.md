## Review Notes (paste into the Notes field)
LinkLoop T1D is a personal wellness journal for Type 1 Diabetes management. It is NOT a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. All glucose data is self-entered by the user or optionally synced from their own Dexcom CGM account with their explicit consent.

Key points for review:
• The app requires account creation or demo login to access features
• Use the demo credentials above to test all features
• AI Insights uses Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) to generate pattern summaries from the user's own data
• Dexcom CGM integration requires the user to authorize via OAuth2 (optional feature)
• Care Circle sharing is opt-in — users invite family members via code or SMS
• The app clearly states it is not a medical device on the login screen and throughout the app
• No in-app purchases or subscriptions
• No third-party advertising
• Privacy policy: https://linkloop-9l3x.onrender.com/privacy.html
