# App Store Screenshots Guide
# ================================================================
# You need screenshots for 6.5" iPhone display
# Size: 1284 × 2778px (portrait)
# You need minimum 1, maximum 10. Apple recommends at least 3-5.

## Screenshots to Create:
# Take these directly from your app running in Expo Go or the dev build.
# Use an iPhone 15 Pro Max, 14 Pro Max, or 11 Pro Max for correct dimensions.
# Or use Simulator → File → Save Screen to capture at exact resolution.

## Recommended Screenshots (in order):

### Screenshot 1 — Home Screen
# Show the 6-card grid (CGM, Care Circle, Supplies, AI Insights, Mood & Notes, Achievements)
# Caption: "Everything in one place"

### Screenshot 2 — CGM / Glucose Tracking
# Show the glucose chart with some readings logged
# Caption: "Track your glucose with ease"

### Screenshot 3 — AI Insights

## How to Take Screenshots:

### Option A: From your physical iPhone
# 1. Open the app on your phone
# 2. Navigate to each screen
# 3. Press Side Button + Volume Up simultaneously
# 4. Screenshots save to Photos
# 5. AirDrop to your Mac

### Option B: From Xcode Simulator
# 1. Run: npx expo start
# 2. Press 'i' to open in iOS Simulator
# 3. In Simulator menu: File → Save Screen (Cmd+S)
# 4. Choose iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator for 6.5" size

### Option C: Use a screenshot tool
# Tools like Rotato, AppMockup, or Screenshots.pro let you
# put your screenshots into device frames with captions.
# This looks more professional on the App Store.

## Notes:
# - No alpha/transparency — must be opaque PNG or JPEG
# - No iPhone bezels in the screenshots themselves (Apple adds those)
# - Keep it clean — show real data, not empty states
# - The demo account has sample data pre-loaded
