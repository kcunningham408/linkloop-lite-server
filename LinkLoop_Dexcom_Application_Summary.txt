  App Name:        LinkLoop
  Platform:        iOS (iPhone)
  Status:          Built, tested, pending TestFlight review
  App Store ID:    6759566762

  Privacy Policy:  https://vibecmd.net/privacy/linkloop
  Version:         1.1.0


  WHAT LINKLOOP DOES
  ------------------
  LinkLoop is a real-time glucose sharing app for the T1D community.

  A T1D "Warrior" connects their Dexcom account once via OAuth. Their latest
  glucose reading, trend arrow, and history are then visible to their approved
  "Care Circle" — family members, caregivers, and loved ones they choose to
  invite via a private invite code.

  The app is built in two layers:

    WARRIOR VIEW
    • Connects Dexcom account via standard OAuth 2.0
    • Syncs glucose readings on demand
    • Views current value, trend arrow, 24-hr history, and stats
    • Manages their Care Circle (invite / remove members)
    • Sets personal high/low thresholds

    CARE CIRCLE MEMBER VIEW
    • Joins warrior's circle using a private invite code
    • Views warrior's real-time glucose data (read-only)
    • Sees current value, trend, and recent history
    • Cannot modify data, access tokens, or share data further


  HOW WE USE THE DEXCOM API
  -------------------------
  Endpoint used:   GET /v3/users/self/egvs  (Estimated Glucose Values)
  Auth method:     OAuth 2.0 — Authorization Code flow
  Scope:           offline_access
  Token storage:   Server-side only (never stored in mobile app)
  Sync model:      User-initiated ("Sync Now" button) — no background polling
  Data stored:     value (mg/dL), trend direction, trend arrow, timestamp
  Data NOT stored: Dexcom username/password, device serial, raw Dexcom user ID

  We do NOT use any other Dexcom endpoints. We do NOT access calibrations,
  devices, events, or any data beyond EGVs.


  TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
  ----------------------
  Mobile App:   React Native / Expo (iOS)
  Backend:      Node.js / Express — hosted on Render.com (US region)
  Database:     MongoDB Atlas (US region, encrypted at rest)
  Transport:    HTTPS / TLS enforced on all endpoints
  Auth:         JWT for app↔server, OAuth 2.0 for server↔Dexcom

  The mobile app never communicates with Dexcom directly.
  All Dexcom API calls are made server-side only.


  USER CONSENT & CONTROL
  ----------------------
  OPT-IN:
    The user must actively tap "Connect Dexcom" in the app.
    They are then redirected to Dexcom's own OAuth login page.
    They log in with their own Dexcom credentials (LinkLoop never sees these).
    They explicitly approve the requested scope on Dexcom's UI.
    No data is fetched before this action is completed.

  REVOCATION (3 options available to user):
    1. Tap "Disconnect Dexcom" in the LinkLoop app
       → All tokens immediately deleted server-side
    2. Revoke access directly at dexcom.com
       → Next sync returns 401, server marks as disconnected automatically
    3. Delete LinkLoop account entirely
       → All data including tokens deleted within 30 days


  PRIVACY & SECURITY
  ------------------
  ✅  Privacy Policy publicly posted: vibecmd.net/privacy/linkloop
  ✅  HTTPS enforced — no unencrypted transmission
  ✅  Dexcom tokens stored server-side only, never in the mobile app
  ✅  MongoDB Atlas — access controls + encryption at rest
  ✅  No data sold, shared with third parties, or used for advertising
  ✅  No ad SDKs, no tracking pixels, no analytics platforms
  ✅  User data deletion honored within 30 days of request
  ✅  Care Circle members get read-only access — no ability to share further


  CURRENT STATUS & LAUNCH PLAN
  ----------------------------
  The app is fully built and tested against the Dexcom Sandbox API.

  We have intentionally held public launch until commercial API access is
  granted. We do not want to release to real users without proper production
  authorization. This application is the final step before launch.

  Once approved:
    Phase 1 — Soft launch to T1D community groups and caregiver networks (US)
    Phase 2 — App Store public listing
    Phase 3 — Outreach to T1D advocacy organizations and diabetes educators

  Expected initial user base: United States only, small/organic growth.
  We are not running paid acquisition campaigns at launch.
